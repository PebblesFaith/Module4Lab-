In module 4, I will build a Trivia web application that is written in JavaScript codes in a set of questions for users to answer and provide a score and game summary; and also, provides a way for users to contribute to the question set that will integrate all my skills learned from my Edx.org, “Building Interactive Prototypes using JavaScript” online course.
